Spot REST Earn

The earn API allows interacting with all of Kraken's yield generating products. It replaces the old /staking part of the API.

The different available earn products are represented by earn strategies. This corresponds to the legacy Staking/Assets. Stake/Unstake are replaced by Allocate/Deallocate.

Overview of available endpoints under Earn​
Strategies - list all earn strategies for which you are eligible or have a balance.
Allocations - lists the balance in your earn account for each strategy. Requires the Query Funds API key permission.
Allocate/Deallocate - allocate/deallocate to an earn strategy through an async operation. Requires the Earn Funds API key permission.
AllocateStatus/DeallocateStatus - verifies the state of the last allocation/deallocation. Requires the Earn Funds or Query Funds API key permission.
Examples​
Determine which funds are earning rewards​
Call Strategies to obtain information about the relevant strategy. The lock_type field shows whether bonding/unbonding funds are earning yield. The relevant fields are bonding_rewards/unbonding_rewards.
Call Allocations for the relevant strategy. From the previous step, for strategies where bonding/unbonding does not earn yield, substract these balances from amount_allocated.total to determine which balances are currently earning.
Get allocatable balance​

Call /0/private/BalanceEx, subtract hold_trading amount. Remaining balance is available for allocation to a strategy.

Geo restrictions​

Some earn strategies are not available in all geographic regions. Strategies will return only strategies available to the caller.
