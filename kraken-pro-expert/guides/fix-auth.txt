FIX Authentication

Both public market data and private trading endpoints requires a first layer of authentication with the usage of SenderCompID (Tag 49) at the logon and on all subsequent messages.

This senderCompId will be provided by Kraken support during onboarding. Spot and Derivative will require 2 different pair of sessions. The Derivatives SenderCompID that you will be given will have a DRV suffix.

For the private logon, another layer of authentication is required and detailed on this page. We recommend using 2 different API Key for Spot and Derivatives but the mechanism to Authenticate will the same on the 2 different sessions. The API Key need to be generated from your pro kraken account in the [settings]https://pro.kraken.com/app/settings/api. You will need to create an SPOT API Key with FIX type for both Spot and Futures.


def get_password(d_msg):
    api_key = "YOUR API_KEY"
    api_secret = "YOUR API_SECRET"
    nonce = str(time.time() * 1000.).split('.')[0]
    message_input = "35=" + "A" + __SOH__ + "34=" + d_msg["34"] + __SOH__ + "49=" + d_msg["49"] + __SOH__ + "56=" + "KRAKEN-TRD" + __SOH__ + "553=" + api_key + __SOH__
    api_sha256 = hashlib.sha256((message_input + nonce).encode("utf-8")).digest()
    api_hmac = hmac.new(base64.b64decode(api_secret), api_sha256, hashlib.sha512)
    fix_password = base64.b64encode(api_hmac.digest())
    return fix_password
