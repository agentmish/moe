Custody Rate Limits
Specific Limits​

Every Custody API user is assigned a "call counter" that begins at 0 and increases by 1 for each call.

The maximum API counter for each user is set at 10. This counter resets after a rolling 10 seconds. Each new request extends the expiration time of the limiter.

When rate limits are reached, additional calls will be restricted for a few seconds, or potentially longer if new calls are initiated while the rate limits remain in effect.

Errors​
"EAPI:Rate limit exceeded" indicates that the REST API counter has surpassed the user's maximum limit.
"EService: Throttled: [UNIX timestamp]" signifies that there are too many concurrent requests. Please try again after [timestamp].
