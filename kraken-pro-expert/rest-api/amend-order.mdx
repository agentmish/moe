Amend Order
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/AmendOrder

The amend request enables clients to modify the order parameters in-place without the need to cancel the existing order and create a new one.

The order identifiers assigned by Kraken and/or client will stay the same.
Queue priority in the order book will be maintained where possible.
If an amend request will reduce the order quantity below the existing filled quantity, the remaining quantity will be cancelled.

For more detail, see amend transaction guide.
