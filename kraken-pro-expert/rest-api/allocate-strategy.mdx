Allocate Earn Funds
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Earn/Allocate

Allocate funds to the Strategy.

Requires the Earn Funds API key permission. The amount must always be defined.

This method is asynchronous. A couple of preflight checks are performed synchronously on behalf of the method before it is dispatched further. The client is required to poll the result using the /0/private/Earn/AllocateStatus endpoint.

There can be only one (de)allocation request in progress for given user and strategy at any time. While the operation is in progress:

pending attribute in /Earn/Allocations response for the strategy indicates that funds are being allocated,
pending attribute in /Earn/AllocateStatus response will be true.

Following specific errors within Earnings class can be returned by this method:

Minimum allocation: EEarnings:Below min:(De)allocation operation amount less than minimum
Allocation in progress: EEarnings:Busy:Another (de)allocation for the same strategy is in progress
Service temporarily unavailable: EEarnings:Busy. Try again in a few minutes.
User tier verification: EEarnings:Permission denied:The user's tier is not high enough
