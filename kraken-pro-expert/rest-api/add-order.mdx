Request​
APPLICATION/JSON
BODYREQUIRED
nonce
int64
REQUIRED

Nonce used in construction of API-Sign header

userref
int32

This is an optional non-unique, numeric identifier which can associated with a number of orders by the client. This field is mutually exclusive with cl_ord_id parameter.

userref is an optional user-specified integer id that can be associated with any number of orders. Many clients choose a userref corresponding to a unique integer id generated by their systems (e.g. a timestamp). However, because we don't enforce uniqueness on our side, it can also be used to easily group orders by pair, side, strategy, etc. This allows clients to more readily cancel or query information about orders in a particular group, with fewer API calls by using userref instead of our txid, where supported.

cl_ord_id
string

Adds an alphanumeric client order identifier which uniquely identifies an open order for each client. This field is mutually exclusive with userref parameter.

The cl_ord_id parameter can be one of the following formats:

• Long UUID: 6d1b345e-2821-40e2-ad83-4ecb18a06876 32 hex characters separated with 4 dashes.
• Short UUID: da8e4ad59b78481c93e589746b0cf91f 32 hex characters with no dashes.
• Free text: arb-20240509-00010 Free format ascii text up to 18 characters.
ordertype
ordertype (string)
REQUIRED

The execution model of the order.

Possible values: [market, limit, iceberg, stop-loss, take-profit, stop-loss-limit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop, trailing-stop-limit, settle-position]

Example: limit
type
string
REQUIRED

Order direction (buy/sell)

Possible values: [buy, sell]

volume
string
REQUIRED

Order quantity in terms of the base asset

Note: Volume can be specified as 0 for closing margin orders to automatically fill the requisite quantity.

Example: 1.25
displayvol
string

For iceberg orders only, it defines the quantity to show in the book while the rest of order quantity remains hidden. Minimum value is 1 / 15 of volume.

pair
string
REQUIRED

Asset pair id or altname

Example: XBTUSD
price
string

Price:

• Limit price for limit and iceberg orders
• Trigger price for stop-loss, stop-loss-limit, take-profit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop and trailing-stop-limit orders

Notes:

• Relative Prices: Either price or price2 can be preceded by +, -, or # to specify the order price as an offset relative to the last traded price. + adds the amount to, and - subtracts the amount from the last traded price. # will either add or subtract the amount to the last traded price, depending on the direction and order type used. Prices can also be suffixed with a % to signify the relative amount as a percentage, rather than an absolute price difference.
• Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely the + prefix, from which the direction will be automatic based on if the original order is a buy or sell (no need to use - or #). The % suffix also works for these order types to use a relative percentage price.
Example: 40000.0
price2
string

Secondary Price:

• Limit price for stop-loss-limit, take-profit-limit and trailing-stop-limit orders

Note:

• Trailing Stops: Must use a relative price for this field, namely one of the + or - prefixes. This will provide the offset from the trigger price to the limit price, i.e. +0 would set the limit price equal to the trigger price. The % suffix also works for this field to use a relative percentage limit price.
trigger
string

Price signal used to trigger stop-loss, stop-loss-limit, take-profit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop and trailing-stop-limit orders

Notes:

• This trigger type will also be used for any associated conditional close orders.
• To keep triggers serviceable, the last price will be used as fallback reference price during connectivity issues with external index feeds.

Possible values: [index, last]

Default value: last
leverage
string

Amount of leverage desired (default: none)

Example: 5
reduce_only
boolean

If true, order will only reduce a currently open position, not increase it or open a new position.

Default value: false
Example: true
stptype
string

Self Trade Prevention (STP) is a protection feature to prevent users from inadvertently or deliberately trading against themselves. To prevent a self-match, one of the following STP modes can be used to define which order(s) will be expired:

• cancel-newest: arriving order will be canceled
• cancel-oldest: resting order will be canceled
• cancel-both: both arriving and resting orders will be canceled

Possible values: [cancel-newest, cancel-oldest, cancel-both]

Default value: cancel-newest
oflags
oflags (string)

Comma delimited list of order flags

• post post-only order (available when ordertype = limit)
• fcib prefer fee in base currency (default if selling)
• fciq prefer fee in quote currency (default if buying, mutually exclusive with fcib)
• nompp disable market price protection for market orders
• viqc order volume expressed in quote currency. This option is supported only for buy market orders. Also not available on margin orders.
Example: post
timeinforce
string

Time-in-force of the order to specify how long it should remain in the order book before being cancelled. GTC (Good-'til-cancelled) is default if the parameter is omitted. IOC (immediate-or-cancel) will immediately execute the amount possible and cancel any remaining balance rather than resting in the book. GTD (good-'til-date), if specified, must coincide with a desired expiretm.

Possible values: [GTC, IOC, GTD]

Default value: GTC
starttm
string

Scheduled start time, can be specified as an absolute timestamp or as a number of seconds in the future:

• 0 now (default)
• <n> = unix timestamp of start time
• +<n> = schedule start time <n> seconds from now
Note that URL encoding of the + character changes it to a space, so please use %2b followed by the number of seconds instead of +
expiretm
string

Expiry time on GTD orders can be set up to one month in future, it is specified as an absolute timestamp or as a number of seconds from now:

• 0 no expiration (default)
• <n> = unix timestamp of expiration time
• +<n> = expire <n> seconds from now, minimum 5 seconds
Note that URL encoding of the + character changes it to a space, so please use %2b followed by the number of seconds instead of +
close[ordertype]
string

Conditional close order type

Note: Conditional close orders are triggered by execution of the primary order in the same quantity and opposite direction, but once triggered are independent orders that may reduce or increase net position

Possible values: [limit, iceberg, stop-loss, take-profit, stop-loss-limit, take-profit-limit, trailing-stop, trailing-stop-limit]

close[price]
string

Conditional close order price

Example: 50000.0
close[price2]
string

Conditional close order price2

deadline
string

RFC3339 timestamp (e.g. 2021-04-01T00:18:45Z) after which the matching engine should reject the new order request, in presence of latency or order queueing: min now() + 2 seconds, max now() + 60 seconds.

validate
boolean

If set to true the order will be validated only, it will not trade in the matching engine.

Default value: false
