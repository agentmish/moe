Get Ledgers Info
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Ledgers

Retrieve information about ledger entries. 50 results are returned at a time, the most recent by default.

Note on Staking/Earn assets: We have begun to migrate assets from our legacy Staking system over to a new Earn system. As such, the following assets may appear in your balances and ledger. Please see our Support article for more details. Note that these assets are "read-only", to interact with your balances in them please use the base asset (e.g. USDT to transact with your USDT and USDT.F balances).

.B, which represents balances in new yield-bearing products, similar to .S (staked) and .M (opt-in rewards) balances
.F, which represents balances earning automatically in Kraken Rewards
