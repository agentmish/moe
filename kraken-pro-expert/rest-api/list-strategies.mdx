Spot REST APIEarnList Earn Strategies
List Earn Strategies
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Earn/Strategies

List earn strategies along with their parameters.

Requires a valid API key but not specific permission is required.

Returns only strategies that are available to the user based on geographic region.

When the user does not meet the tier restriction, can_allocate will be false and allocation_restriction_info indicates Tier as the restriction reason. Earn products generally require Intermediate tier. Get your account verified to access earn.

A note about lock_type:

instant: can be deallocated without an unbonding period. This is called flexible in the UI.
bonded: has an unbonding period. Deallocation will not happen until this period has passed.
flex: "Kraken rewards". This is earning on your spot balances where eligible. It's turned on account wide from the UI and you cannot manually allocate to these strategies.

Paging isn't yet implemented, so the endpoint always returns all data in the first page.
