Get Deallocation Status
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Earn/DeallocateStatus

Get the status of the last deallocation request.

Requires either the Earn Funds or Query Funds API key permission.

(De)allocation operations are asynchronous and this endpoint allows client to retrieve the status of the last dispatched operation. There can be only one (de)allocation request in progress for given user and strategy.

The pending attribute in the response indicates if the previously dispatched operation is still in progress (true) or has successfully completed (false). If the dispatched request failed with an error, then HTTP error is returned to the client as if it belonged to the original request.

Following specific errors within Earnings class can be returned by this method:

Insufficient funds: EEarnings:Insufficient funds:Insufficient funds to complete the (de)allocation request
Minimum allocation: EEarnings:Below min:(De)allocation operation amount less than minimum
