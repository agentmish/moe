Deallocate Earn Funds
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Earn/Deallocate

Deallocate funds from a strategy.

Requires the Earn Funds API key permission. The amount must always be defined.

This method is asynchronous. A couple of preflight checks are performed synchronously on behalf of the method before it is dispatched further. If the method returns HTTP 202 code, the client is required to poll the result using the /Earn/DeallocateStatus endpoint.

There can be only one (de)allocation request in progress for given user and strategy. While the operation is in progress:

pending attribute in Allocations response for the strategy will hold the amount that is being deallocated (negative amount)
pending attribute in DeallocateStatus response will be true.

Following specific errors within Earnings class can be returned by this method:

Minimum allocation: EEarnings:Below min:(De)allocation operation amount less than minimum allowed
Allocation in progress: EEarnings:Busy:Another (de)allocation for the same strategy is in progress
Strategy not found: EGeneral:Invalid arguments:Invalid strategy ID
