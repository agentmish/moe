Get Trade Volume
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/TradeVolume

Returns 30 day USD trading volume and resulting fee schedule for any asset pair(s) provided. Fees will not be included if pair is not specified as Kraken fees differ by asset pair. Note: If an asset pair is on a maker/taker fee schedule, the taker side is given in fees and maker side in fees_maker. For pairs not on maker/taker, they will only be given in fees.
