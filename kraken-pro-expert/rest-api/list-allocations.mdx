Spot REST APIEarnList Earn Allocations
List Earn Allocations
POST
https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Earn/Allocations

List all allocations for the user.

Requires the Query Funds API key permission.

By default all allocations are returned, even for strategies that have been used in the past and have zero balance now. That is so that the user can see how much was earned with given strategy in the past. hide_zero_allocations parameter can be used to remove zero balance entries from the output. Paging hasn't been implemented for this method as we don't expect the result for a particular user to be overwhelmingly large.

All amounts in the output can be denominated in a currency of user's choice (the converted_asset parameter).

Information about when the next reward will be paid to the client is also provided in the output.

Allocated funds can be in up to 4 states:

bonding
allocated
exit_queue (ETH only)
unbonding

Any funds in total not in bonding/unbonding are simply allocated and earning rewards. Depending on the strategy funds in the other 3 states can also be earning rewards. Consult the output of /Earn/Strategies to know whether bonding/unbonding earn rewards. ETH in exit_queue still earns rewards.

Note that for ETH, when the funds are in the exit_queue state, the expires time given is the time when the funds will have finished unbonding, not when they go from exit queue to unbonding.

(Un)bonding time estimate can be inaccurate right after having (de)allocated the funds. Wait 1-2 minutes after (de)allocating to get an accurate result.
